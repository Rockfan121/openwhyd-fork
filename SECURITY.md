## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please create an issue on this repository or contact use privately by email: contact@openwhyd.org.

When reporting a vulnerability, the following information is appreciated:

- risk: what may happen until we fix it
- cause: (potential) issue causing the vulnerability, if possible by including links to specific parts of our codebase
- steps to exploit that vulnerability
- intentions: e.g. would you be interested in providing a fix?

We will do our best to reply within 5 working days. If you get no answer after that period, please try to reach us by another mean.

Openwhyd is an non-profit projet maintained by a single developer on his spare time. Thank you in advance for your help and understanding!
